# WhatsOpen

Scrape.py takes data once an hour from https://brandeis.sodexomyway.com/dining-near-me/open-now using the beautiful soup library and selenium. It sends a list of the open dining halls to a google firebase. Then the app WhatsOpen reads the firebase to have an instant list of dining options on campus.
